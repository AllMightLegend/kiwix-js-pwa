## Chromium browsers have first-class support for PWAs on Android

**Chromium** browsers (Chrome, Edge, Samsung, etc.) supports installing PWAs on Android (as well as on Desktop), and also have large quotas
for the Origin Private File System (OPFS). Installing the PWA useful, because the app runs in its own dedicated session and has its own icon
in your Home Screen (or Start menu on Windows).

## Why bother using the OPFS if I can just pick a file from anywhere?

File access is much, much faster (approx. 10x faster) for archives in the Origin Private File System than for archives picked from the visible
file system. Full-text search also works for archives in the OPFS, whereas access is too slow for that search type to be feasible for other
archives. However, for very large archives like full English Wikipedia which won't fit in the OPFS, you can still pick these archives from
anywhere on your device, including microSD cards.
